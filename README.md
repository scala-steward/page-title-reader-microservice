# Crawler.

Give urls, get page titles

## What crawler does

1.  It gets page title for each of given url's in a list.
1.  If URL is presented several times, it will be fetched once, but result will be printed several times, in the same order as in a source list.
1.  It does not follow redirects immediately. Instead, it responds with a new location, so you can handle redirection before getting a final result.
1.  It handles non-urls, empty strings, inaccessible hosts and http codes in a predictable manner

It works well against cases like these:

```json
[
  "https://ya.ru",
  "www.dictionary.com/browse/http",
  "https://api.github.com/",
  "http://ya.ru",
  "shit://yandex.ru",
  "https://github.com/ladsgfadg",
  "adsfgasdfg",
  "",
  "https://ya.ru"
]
```

... which result in:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://ya.ru",
    "title": "Яндекс"
  },
  {
    "url": "www.dictionary.com/browse/http",
    "title": "Http | Define Http at Dictionary.com"
  },
  {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/",
    "error": "Page has no title"
  },
  {
    "url": "http://ya.ru",
    "error": "Redirect: https://ya.ru/"
  },
  {
    "url": "shit://yandex.ru",
    "error": "Bad url"
  },
  {
    "url": "https://github.com/ladsgfadg",
    "error": "Status code: 404"
  },
  {
    "url": "adsfgasdfg",
    "error": "Inaccessible host"
  },
  {
    "url": "",
    "error": "Inaccessible host"
  },
  {
    "url": "https://ya.ru",
    "title": "Яндекс"
  }
]
```
